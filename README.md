# pull-request-analysis

Python app that I've put together to download all of the open pull requests on the Magento 2 repo via the Github API and display some stats about 
them.

My goal is to better understand the state of the open pull requests so that we as a community know where to rally to help reduce the number of open 
pull requests.

Thanks to Streamlit Community, you can view the data visualization online at 
[https://joshuaswarren-pull-request-analysis-streamlit-app-oecgov.streamlit.app](https://joshuaswarren-pull-request-analysis-streamlit-app-oecgov.streamlit.app) 
- without needing to run this code yourself. If you're the first visitor in a while, you'll have to wait for it to call the API and process the data, 
but after that it uses cached data.

If there are additional visualizations you feel would be beneficial for the community, feel free to submit a pull request!
